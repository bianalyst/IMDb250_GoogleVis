The IMDb Top 250 list [1] celebrates outstanding films, cinema's development over the past 100 year and its variety. However, the master minds behind these movies are not as manifold as the list's title suggests. As few as 22 directors created 40% of the entire list (102 movies). Through the decades these filmmakers not only defined cinema, they defined their era: From Charlie Chaplin in 1921 to Christopher Nolan today.
